between in the hydrogen burning, helium burning, carbon burning, neon burning is close to 1000 times duration of each. oxygen burning (1000 days), silicon burning (1 day), core collapse (0.2 second), surface shockwave (few hours)

When a star creates neon, it will create iron. The nether star created its name. Neon means new, therefore when the wither is created, it is the beginning.

actually, #fripside were setting the bags down right when the #unit731 were being mentioned in english text. However, general Patton shows disgust of the idea of "japanese believing in christ and going to heaven" just like

  showing disgust after opening the bag

#fripside Also my youtube video has coincidences. It was unintended for: 
words to start scrolling at the first scene of human
english words start scrolling right after instrumental break
unit 731 being mentioned in english when #fripside start unzipping bags

  fan fic: in 2009, nanjolno applied and got into Yale University, she rejected the offer because she got accepted in milky holmes anime as a Harvard graduate. 

To foreign fans: it is widely known that Harvard students reject Yale University.

#NewYearsResolution113
New years resolution: don’t get a job, drop out of college, be lazy, homeless.

I was once living in a NATO country. I decide I want to support the Russia in the Russia-Ukraine war by moving to Russia.

япония должна отдать КНДР свои украденные собственности, земли, люди, патенты или ещё худшее будет происходить.
